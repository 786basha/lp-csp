                        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> Limited Infrastructure <br> <p style="padding: 20px;">Many rural areas lack proper infrastructure, including schools, classrooms, and educational facilities. This shortage makes it difficult for students to access quality education within their immediate vicinity</p>

The limited number of teachers available may result in larger class sizes and hinder individual attention and personalized learning experiences for students.</p>
